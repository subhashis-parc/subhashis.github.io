## Machine Learning Assisted Visual Analytics <i>i.e, <i>ML4VA</i>



Besides accurately predicting the outcomes of high-dimensional non-linear functions, many state-of-the-art deep learning models can also be utilized to interpret and analyze the underlying physical phenomena in greater details. By opening the so called, <i>black-box</i> of these powerful machine learning models, we can extract interesting insights about the application domain which the models learned during the training process. In this project, we incorporate some of the recent advances from the field of <i>uncertainty quantification</i>, <i>interpretability</i>, and <i>explainability</i> of deep learning models to design interactive visual analysis frameworks to facilitate an exploratory analysis workflow for the domain experts. We worked with computational biologists to create an interactive visual analysis framework to analyze the dynamics of a computationally expensive <i>yeast cell polarization</i> simulation model. A trained <i>neural network-based surrogate model</i> acts as the backend analysis framework, driving our frontend visual analysis system. We were able to visually guide the experts in the process of discovering new and previously unseen simulation input parameter configurations of interest.
